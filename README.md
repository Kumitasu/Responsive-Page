This is my first Responsive Landing Page. I've been doing it as part of coding bootcamp (CodersLab) for JS. 
Project uses following:

1.HTML
  - First attempt to write clean html with **BEM methodology**

2.CSS/SASS
  - Adding **mixins** for responsiveness
  - Using **@import** to create easier accessibility for each part to style it in future

3.JS
  - **QuerySelector**
  - Operating with **this.**
  - Using **addEventListener**
  - **If** function

4.Gulp

Sill learning and improving. If there are thing to improve in this project let me know :)
